# IBM RPA Automation Examples

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a couple of examples running IBM RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to automate two use cases.

## Lab 1 - Web Data Collection and Email Automation

In this script, you can see how the robot accesses an internal webpage, collects information from the webpage, and then sends an email with that information. You can watch the execution in the `Lab1-Demo.mov` file.

## Lab 2 - Data Processing and Report Generation

In Lab2, the information from this endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/region/america is read and saved into an Excel file.

## Benefits of IBM RPA

These types of tools greatly facilitate the automation of manual processes within organizations, leading to increased efficiency and accuracy, reduced operational costs, and improved overall productivity.
